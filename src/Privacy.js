                            <br/>Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may
                            still send you transactional communications for your convenience, including emails about the
                            services you request from Ina+Forbes.
                            <br/>Automatically collected information
                            <br/>Transactions and Activity - If you become a registered user or if you conduct transactions
                            through this website, we may collect information about the transactions you engage in while on
                            the website and your other activity on the website. This information may include areas of the
                            website that you visit, transaction types, content that you view, download or submit, transaction
                            amounts, payment, and billing information as well as the nature, quantity and price of the goods
                            or services you exchange and the individuals or entities with whom you communicate or transact
                            business.
                            <br/>Device & Location Information - When you use a smartphone or other mobile device to access
                            the website, use a computer to access our website, or use our mobile application, we may
                            collect information about your physical location and the device and browser used. This
                            information can not be connected to you personally, and presents in the form of non-personal
                            aggregated data. Ina+Forbes does not use third party services or tools to attempt to remove
                            anonymity from this data.
                            <br/>Cookies and Other Tools - We may also employ "cookie" or “beacon” technologies. A
                            "cookie" is a small file that we may place on your hard drive to identify you when you visit our
                            website. A “beacon”, or a “pixel”, may be embedded on our webpage to communicate certain
                            information from your device to us or a third party. We use these technologies to analyze
                            our website’s structure, improve your browsing experience, track general website usage, and
                            to tailor advertisements to you. Most browsers have built-in options to opt out of cookie or
                            beacon-based tracking, and we encourage you to explore these tools if you wish to be exempt
                            from the use of cookies.
                            How We Use Your Information
                            <br/>We only use personally identifying for improving service to you, including: processing and
                            serving your transactions, such as reservations; providing services and support; providing users
                            with product or service updates, promotional notices and offers, and other information about
                            Ina+Forbes; responding to your questions inquiries, comments and instructions; and maintaining
                            the security and integrity of our systems.
                            <br/>We may engage other companies to assist with promotions, provide technical assistance,
                            customize or personalize the advertisements that are displayed to you, and for other legitimate
                            business purposes (collectively, "Third Parties"). We may share portions of your information with
                            these Third Parties and these Third Parties will use your information only in ways necessary to
                            fulfill their obligations to Ina+Forbes, and for no other purpose. All Third Parties are contractually
                            bound to never disclose, store, or use information we provide them outside of the scope of their
                            work with us. We will not make your information available to any unrelated business or activity
                            for any reason.
                            <br/>We reserve the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation
                            or other legal request, to protect the integrity of the website, to fulfill your requests, or to
                            cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or any other investigation related to public
                            safety.
                            <br/>Sharing and Protecting Your Information
                            <br/>Third Parties may collect information through the methods described in the “Information
                            We Collect” Section above. They also may possess or obtain information about you from
                            your interactions: directly with the third party companies; or from your interactions with
                            advertisements Third Parties display to you.
                            <br/>Marketing partners and other third parties also may collect information about your activity
                            on our sites and on third-party sites using tracking technologies. Tracking data collected by
                            these third parties is used to decide which ads you see on third-party sites and applications.
                            You may choose not to receive targeted advertising from many ad networks by visiting the
                            following websites: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp/or http://
                            www.aboutads.info/choices/.
                            <br/>We may also use third party social platforms such as Facebook to provide users customized
                            advertisements. In this instance, any personal information that a user shared with the social
                            platform is converted into a unique value, which makes their information anonymous. You can
                            visit Facebook for more information on their privacy policies: https://www.facebook.com/
                            about/privacy/.
